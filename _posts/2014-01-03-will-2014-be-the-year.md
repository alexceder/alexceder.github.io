title: Will 2014 be THE year?
---
As the title asks, will this be the year? Where I finally grow some balls, however small that growth may be, to use this domain name and actually write something? Even if what I write are long sentences as the one preceding this one. Will I be grammatically correct? Will I be inspiring? Will someone read the crap I write? Maybe some of these questions will be answered if I do in fact write something in this forsaken window to the Internet some might call a blog. Should I call it that? We will see. Hopefully not too many will laugh at how ridiculous this is. Or maybe you guys will. Hopefully I won't care too much.

I do not want to leave you with no content what so ever, so let me tell you about what I've been struggling with the last two days. Best practices.. best practices are a bitch, well at least if you are like me. It hinders me to the point where I cannot write one line of code for long periods of time. I feel the need to do whatever I am doing the best way possible, the **correct way**, if that makes any sense, as compared to just doing it and learning as I stumble.

> **Side note:** Some of my implementations I thought was done in "best practice" would probably make some of you laugh.

I know that if I just do *something*, I will learn how to do it better next time. But it still hinders me from writing those first lines of code, *jumping in* that is. In a way I guess that is my New Years resolution, to write code. Not worrying about if my way is the *absolute best* way of doing what I am doing, and just *do it* and hopefully learn in the process. I do not know if any of that made any sense, but hey, sue me.

I hope that this source of content can help others or start a conversation. And if it does not *(I know that no one will ever read this)* hopefully it will help me.
