I am current looking to find a well-suited place at which to do my thesis work.
My plan is to start in the beginning of fall 2016.

Some subjects of interest:

* Computer Graphics
* Data Engineering and Visualization
* User Experience
* Entrepreneurship

You may check out my [Projects](/projects), to get a sense of my interests and
abilities. Please contact me at any time if you are interested and/or have any
questions.
