I have spent this past Saturday alone at home. There has been &mdash; and there
still is &mdash; an uneasy sensation hanging in the air. It cannot be touched,
however its presence is painfully obvious to all other senses.

During these experiences with loneliness, motivation dies. If ever I feel as if
I am ahead it is during the night when I reckon most people are asleep. This
gives me an edge, small as it may be. I am up doing thing when everyone is
asleep, doing nothing but resting. I tell myself that I do not need sleep.
Tomorrow when these sleepers will be awake, the collective energy in the cosmos
will have to be split among all of them. Tonight it is just me, and possibly a
few other miserable people sharing.
