Tube Wars is a two-on-two, fast paced, arena-style, first-person shooter game that me and a few friends made as a project for school. I modeled, textured and animated everything except for the characters, designed the UI, and wrote a bunch of the game logic. The game was nominated for a Kuberna award, organized by the student society.
